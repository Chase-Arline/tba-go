# tba-go
golang library/CLI package for the blue alliance website access (FRC competition data)

This allows teams to pull OPR/DPR/CCWM status at individual matches in the competition. 
Normally a team could only pull this data in between each match, but this recalculates the OPR using the same algorithm as TBA.
Data can be exported into CSV files.
